## Assignment 3 Subscription Form 

## Struggles/obstacles and notes
Had some trouble making the text easier to read. Choose a good contrast background or put a layer/bold behind your text. 
Choosing what to put in a div was also a little confusing. Assigned classes to some tags to make it easier
for me to customize.
